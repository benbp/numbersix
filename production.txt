Dried Chilis
	65 g arbol ( I only de-stem these, too much work to stem and seed )
	65 g guajillo ( Remove stems and seeds )

Put these in the blender and blend them into chili powder

Toast ( separately, under oven broiler or in a cast iron pan )
	1 cup pumpkin seeds - slightly dark, don't let any seeds go black
( I have also used a popcorn popper or the pumpkin seeds with good results)
	1/2 cup sesame seeds -- nice round medium

Add all the dry inregidents, and just enough of the liquid mixture so you can
blend everything into a very smooth paste.

16 large allspice berries ( 2.2 g )
18 cloves
1 T cumin seeds
4 tsp mexican oregano
3 T dried roasted garlic
1 T salt
6 T cocoa nibs

Add remaining liquid to blender, blend briefly to mix in liquid

Liquid:
	6 cup water
	3 cup apple cider vinegar

Fills 12-14 5oz bottles of sauce
