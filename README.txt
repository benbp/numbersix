This is Number Six ( this is a old version of http://toyland.org/numbersix )

Once upon a time there was a yummy hot sauce that you could buy in
stores. It was just hot enough to be interesting, but not so hot
you couldn't load things up and get a lot of flavor. Then evil came
to the land and you could no longer buy this hot sauce in stores.

Fear not, brave readers, for this story has a happy ending. Alchemy
and other Ancient Practices have been able to produce a new sauce,
which is even better than the vanished sauce. This new sauce is
called "Number Six", because it is the seventh variation on the
original recipe, and computer programmers like to count starting
at zero.

This sauce is not for sale. The recipe is right here, feel free to
make your own. Or you can wait until the next time I make a batch,
and get one in a bottle with a label of great goodness.

Speaking of the label, in exchange for hot sauce, Master of Line
and Leverage Paul Soupiset designed the label. The sauce and the
logo are both full of awesome, and that is the truth.

I am always looking for excuses to use the hot sauce. Here is a
short list of things the sauce makes better:

    Soup, Gravy, Stew, Meatloaf, Turkey Sandwich, Quesadilla, Eggs, Potatoes,
    Guacamole, Beans, Mixed with mayonnaise for Artichoke Sauce

For the sake of honesty, here is the list of things which the sauce
does not make better:

    Vanilla Ice Cream, American Politics

The Recipes

The best secrets are the one you tell everyone, every chance you
get. This sauce is meant to be that kind of secret, which is why
there is a recipe printed on the label. To be clear, the sauce which
matches that recipe is very good, people have wept with joy as they
ate food items enhanced with that sauce. However, I am always working
on making the recipe better. The version here is much better than
the version on the bottle.

There is a possibility that making this sauce requires a +3 blender
of science. I have to push my Vitamix pretty hard to take the sauce
from "ground up parts with chili sauce aspirations" to actual sauce
consistency.

I also have to acknowledge that this is essentially my version of
a recipe you can find all over the internet, because it was first
published by Rick Bayless.  I started there, but Number Six is
better, in my not so humble opinion.

WARNING: When de-seeding the large pile of chili pods, or running
the blender for the larger amount of sauce, you will be exposing
yourself to a significant amount chili vapors. Wearing latex gloves
makes the de-seeding easier, and makes it less likely you will give
yourself an unpleasant chili rub in the eyesocket, and running a
fan or other ventilation strategies is a really good idea.
