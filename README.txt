This is Number Six ( this is a old version of http://toyland.org/numbersix )

Once upon a time there was a yummy hot sauce that you could buy in
stores. It was just hot enough to be interesting, but not so hot
you couldn't load things up and get a lot of flavor. Then evil came
to the land and you could no longer buy this hot sauce in stores.

Fear not, brave readers, for this story has a happy ending. Alchemy
and other Ancient Practices have been able to produce a new sauce,
which is even better than the vanished sauce. This new sauce is
called "Number Six", because it is the seventh variation on the
original recipe, and computer programmers like to count starting
at zero.

This sauce is not for sale. The recipe is right here, feel free to
make your own. Or you can wait until the next time I make a batch,
and get one in a bottle with a label of great goodness.

Speaking of the label, in exchange for hot sauce, Master of Line
and Leverage Paul Soupiset designed the label. The sauce and the
logo are both full of awesome, and that is the truth.

I am always looking for excuses to use the hot sauce. Here is a
short list of things the sauce makes better:

    Soup, Gravy, Stew, Meatloaf, Turkey Sandwich, Quesadilla, Eggs, Potatoes,
    Guacamole, Beans, Mixed with mayonnaise for Artichoke Sauce

For the sake of honesty, here is the list of things which the sauce
does not make better:

    Vanilla Ice Cream, American Politics

Alternative History

Here is Debbie's version of The History of The Sauce. I can neither
conform nor deny allegations made in this account.

    Our friend Michael Toy is a great cook and is especially talented
    in creating new recipes and delicious dishes. When his favorite
    picante sauce quit business he picked up the broken pieces of
    his life and focused what little energy he had left in his
    wasted away body and devoted himself to creating the perfect
    hot sauce. Many would get glimpses of his shadowy figure darkening
    the doorway of Penzeys spices only to have him vanish back to
    his laboratory where he would remove himself from proper society
    for days or even weeks its suspected, trying to unlock the
    mysteries the universe cruelly with-held from him until they
    knew he was mentally emotionally and spiritually ready to handle
    the complex answers he sought. Bedraggled and chili stained he
    one day stumbled from his kitchen pale faced and gaunt but
    weakly smiling grasping with his thin fingers the perfect bottle
    of sauce.  It's rumored he shut his bedroom door, closed the
    blinds and took the next severals weeks recovering from this
    watershed event, being lovingly nursed back to health by his
    longsuffering wife, soul mate, and companion, Linda. She now
    undergoes treatment for over-doting and is rumored will soon
    embark on a spiritual journey in an attempt to recalibrate her
    inner child. Well I'm pretty sure that's not the entire story
    but that's all I can "publicly" comment on at the time. You'll
    need to read the NATIONAL ENQUIRER to get the full story.

The Recipes

The best secrets are the one you tell everyone, every chance you
get. This sauce is meant to be that kind of secret, which is why
there is a recipe printed on the label. To be clear, the sauce which
matches that recipe is very good, people have wept with joy as they
ate food items enhanced with that sauce. However, I am always working
on making the recipe better. The version here is much better than
the version on the bottle.

Even though recipe are really the original open source, when I say
"open source hot sauce", people laugh. So, mostly for fun, I've
decided to keep the current best version on github. If you would
like, you can view the recipes there.

There is a possibility that making this sauce requires a +3 blender
of science. I have to push my Vitamix pretty hard to take the sauce
from "ground up parts with chili sauce aspirations" to actual sauce
consistency.

I also have to acknowledge that this is essentially my version of
a recipe you can find all over the internet, because it was first
published by Rick Bayless. Here's a great blog post from someone
who made that original recipe. I started there, but Number Six is
better, in my not so humble opinion.

WARNING: When de-seeding the large pile of chili pods, or running
the blender for the larger amount of sauce, you will be exposing
yourself to a significant amount chili vapors. Wearing latex gloves
makes the de-seeding easier, and makes it less likely you will give
yourself an unpleasant chili rub in the eyesocket, and running a
fan or other ventilation strategies is a really good idea.
